overview: Toybox Titans is a 3 vs 1 multiplayer games set in a kids bedroom. The goal of the game is to destroy the defending toy in their crafted arena. After hearing about the project from some peers within CG Spectrum I decided to join and help create a vertical slice. Myself and 30 other team members have spent 4 months designing, creating a testing the game. Unfortunately we havent got a video of any of our play tests so the demo video is small slice of what the game is but it showcases some of the features I have worked on and implemented.
bullets: Setup Perforce within Azure cloud for the whole team, Created combat mechanics using GAS (Melee, Ranged and Throwables), Implemented designer changable UI that hooked into Game logic e.g changing icon when ability is inactive, Created shaders to see some characters through the wall, Created shader for invisible wall that would only display when the player is close to the wall, Created camera modifiers to change camera behavour based on designer requested, Created simple blueprintable interface for the ability system that our designers could use to minimise there needed knowledge of the gameplay ability system, Worked closely with design to create configurable systems and gameplay elements that could fix player requirements, Created a series of tutorial videos to document how to modify values and what those values do
