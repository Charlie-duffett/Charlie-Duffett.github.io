overview: The Console FPS project was created during my Introduction to Programming course at CG Spectrum. Inspired by classic Wolfenstein games, which shared similarities with the course project (albeit rendered top-down), I sought to enhance the course material by transitioning it into a first-person perspective. This initiative led me to explore and implement a ray casting game renderer within the constraints of the course project, resulting in a significantly improved final game.
bullets: Created level editor to allow users to create their own ingame levels, Saved levels into a file, Allowed users to select a level file to play, Created a ray cast renderer, Implemented colour into the renderer, Implemented basic sound through the beep function

code: Code snippets are available on request. I am also happy to provide the whole project
lessons-learned: <b>Application of C++ in Game Development</b>| Through the Console FPS project_ I gained valuable experience in applying my knowledge of C++ to game development. This involved understanding core programming concepts and implementing them within the context of game design_ further solidifying my proficiency in the language, <b>Creation of a Ray Casting Renderer</b>| One of the major learning experiences from the project was the development of a ray casting renderer. This involved researching how ray casting renderers work and implementing them to create a functional game renderer. This hands-on experience not only expanded my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of game engine architecture, <b>Utilization of Maths in Game Development</b>| Another significant takeaway from the project was the application of mathematics in game development. It served as an excellent opportunity to refresh my mathematical knowledge and explore its practical use in game development contexts. Through tasks like implementing collision detection_ rendering_ and player movement_ I gained a deeper appreciation for the foundational role of mathematics in game development. This experience not only reinforced the importance of mathematical principles but also strengthened my ability to address complex game mechanics effectively
