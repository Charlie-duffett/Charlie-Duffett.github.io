overview: This project was created during my introduction to programming course I took at CG spectrum. <br/>Normally to pass the course they require you to create a simple top down game in the Windows console. However during the course i noticed we was creating something that reminded me how the Wolfenstein 3D game was made. So after finding a tutorial series by OneLoneCoder(javidx9) I created this! <br/> <br/> The Final project included a level editor aswell as the ability to load and play your created levels.
detailed-description: During this projected I learnt about how a ray casting engine works and was able to successfully implement it. Although I followed a tuturial video to create teh ray cast my code varies in structure quite abit as I modulised the code to fix the program i was creating before I realised this was something i wanted to create. <br/> By "upgrading" the original aim of the course to this it means that any older versions of the code base are more or less compatible with this version. The only requiremeant is that the version supports coloured keys/doors. <br/> <br/> Due to the fact the tuturial video i followed didnt include colour support I researched and implemented my own way to support colour. I did this by using the "WriteConsoleOutputAttribute" function that was supplied an array of colours for each "pixel" on the screen.
