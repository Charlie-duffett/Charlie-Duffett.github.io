overview: The Console FPS project was done over the course of the Introduction to Programing course I took at CG Spectrum. In this I created a first person maze(ish) game where you had to find keys to open doors which would eventually lead you to the exit. I created this after following a tutorial video on ray casting done by the youtube Javidx9(OneLoneCoder)
bullets: Created level editor to allow users to create their own ingame levels, Saved levels into a file, Allowed users to select a level file to play, Modalised ray casting code shown in the tutorial to fit my application, Improved on the tutorials code by implementing colour into the game, Implemented basic sound through the beep function
