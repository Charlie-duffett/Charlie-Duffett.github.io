overview: The Console FPS project was done over the course of the Introduction to Programing course I took at CG Spectrum. I realised that the application the course was making us create was very similar to how the old school wolfenstein games worked. (however only rendered top down) So I might it my goal to enhance the courses game to work in first person instead. This is what I managed to create
bullets: Created level editor to allow users to create their own ingame levels, Saved levels into a file, Allowed users to select a level file to play, Created a ray cast renderer, Implemented colour into the renderer, Implemented basic sound through the beep function
demo: https://www.youtube.com/embed/db7NSggCfNQ
code: Code snippets are available on request. I am also happy to provide the whole project
