overview: The Cube was a team project challenge set by CG Spectrum. Teamed up with a game designer, we set out designing and creating a game that would push the boundaries on what we already knew. This was my first game project in Unreal Engine and thus was also my 1st attempt at implementing an algorithm to dynamically spawn actors within the engine. This experience presented both challenges and opportunities for growth as I navigated the intricacies of Unreal Engine and honed my skills in algorithmic implementation.
bullets: Created a structure spawner to be used with a maze generation algorithm, Programmed a maze generation algorithm using loop erased walk (wilsons algorithm), Configured a ball object to be able to move through the maze based on rotation, Created player controls to move the ball by tilting the maze, Created end portal which when activated changed the level to the end game screen, Taught designer parts of the unreal engine and gave simple tasks to showcase learning opportunities

code: The code for this project can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/Charlie-duffett/BallInHoop">Github</a>
lessons-learned: <b>Dynamically spawning Actors</b>| One of the key technical challenges I tackled during the project was learning how to spawn in actors dynamically. This required me to take a step into the dark and learn how different parts of the engine worked that I hadnt seen before. I managed to successfully implemented this which is one of the key highlights of the project, <b>Maze Generation with Loop Erased Walk Alorithm</b>| Reflecting on the project_ I gained valuable experience in maze generation techniques_ mainly through my implementation of the loop erased walk algorithm. Learning this has expanded my understanding of procedural content generation and its applications in game development, <b>Importance of Bettter Control Design</b>| In hindsight_ we should have spent more time refining the controls and the feel of moving the maze around_ as the final game had lackluster and frustrating controls. This led to the game not being as enjoyable as it could have been. Although the game is technically sound_ the controls were a significant drawback. If given the opportunity to redo the project_ I would allocate more time to ensure that the controls are satisfying and contribute positively to the overall gameplay experience
