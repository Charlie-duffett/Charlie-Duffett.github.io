overview: Project memories is a project that I have joined on as a programmer. The goal is to create a puzzle/platformer game with the theme based around dealing with grief. Each of the 5 main levels will be based on a different stage of grief.
bullets: Created interactable class used to pickup items, Created lantern actor to allow the player to light up the world aswell as interact with gameplay elements, Started on implementing platforms that are only useable when light touches them.
