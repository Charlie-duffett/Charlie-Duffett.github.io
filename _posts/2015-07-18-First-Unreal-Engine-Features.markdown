overview: This is my first ever project in Unreal which was created along side of the tutorials as part of the CG Spectrem Game Programming course. In addition to this i also developed a simple telekinesis mechanic inspired by the psyconaughts game series. 
bullets: Created door that is opened when a player steps into a trigger zone, Created objective system for the player to complete (Open the door!), Implemented basic UI to tell the player their objective, Created telekinesis power up allowing the player to move a cube around the world
