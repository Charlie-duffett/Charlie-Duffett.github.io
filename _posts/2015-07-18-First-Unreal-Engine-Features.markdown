overview: This project was my first look at Unreal engine. I originally started following the lessons in my CG specturm game development course however after speaking with my mentor i created a small feature similar to the psyconaughts telekinsis ability.
detailed-description: The first thing that i learnt to do within unreal was to create character movement and take input from the player. Rather than using the 3rd person starter app i was tasked with creating this from the beginning using blueprint. <br/><br/> The next task I was assigned was to create a door that could open when you touched a trigger box. I did this by creating a door component that could be supplied with a trigger box that is already placed in the world. When the trigger box is activated I simply rotate the door to a designer supplied degrees. <br/> <br/> Finally in this project after speaking with my mentor I created a talakinsis ability where you can pick up an object of class (pickupable object). Then when you was holding the object you can push it away form you or bring it towards you.
