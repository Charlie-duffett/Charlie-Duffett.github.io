overview: This project is an enhancement on the UE4 Stratergy Game that Epic have created. My Mentor had upaded it to work on UE5 and I made changes from there. These changes included updating the wave system and fixing some major bugs in the game!
detailed-description: To start with I had to fix i pretty big and glaring bug with the game. The enemy or allied minions couldnt cross the bridge to the aliied teams base! To do this i had to learn how Nav meshes worked and I had to add a blocking volume under the bride to make the minions cross the bridge. After making that change I also changed the collision on the gold collectables as the minions would just walk through it. <br/><br/> The next change I decided to make was to improve the wave system. I wanted to make it so rather than jumping straight into the game you would have time to prepare and then ready up before a wave started. So I implemented a new game state (buying) and updated the ui to allow the user to ready up before each wave. <br/><br/> Once this was done I turned my attention to the arrow turrent as I felt the way it worked wasnt really ideal for this type of game. The range was way to long and the firing was continous. Instead I updated the turret to have a shorter range and only fire when a minion got close. <br/> Doing this alone was fine however I decided to make some tweaks and set a delay between firing to limit how much damage the tower could do but to counter that I made it fire a bunch of projectiles in a short amount of time. This greatly increased its damage but limited it to how many minions it could actually deal damage to. <br/><br/> Another bug with the cannon and arrow tower I found was the fact they actually dealt no damage! Which as you can imagine isnt ideal for a tower defense game. This was cause by my mentor commenting out deprecated code as part of his upgrade UE5. Once that was found it was a simple fix and finally I could see my tower doing damage. <br/><br/> I have one final goal for this project at the time of writing this which is to spawn a player controlled minion at the start of each wave for the player to use and help defend against the attacking wave. If the player was to die while controlling the minion they will just be brought back to the top down view. I feel like this will add a extra layer of fun to the game as you cannot buy any towers etc during a wave.
