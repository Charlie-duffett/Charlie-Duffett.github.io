overview: After discussing my desire to create a game in Unreal my mentor suggested I start on adding features to the base Unreal Stratergy game that Epic provide. My Mentor had also upgrade the stratergy game to work with Unreal Engine 5 So this was my first project in that unreal version. I set out some goals for myself when starting this project which where to update the wave behaviour, Change how the arrow turret works and have some sort of third person mode within the game.
bullets: Added new wave start called buying where players will be able to buy towers without the threat of an on going wave, Created ready up mechanic to allow the player to build towers before the start of the first wave, Programmed simple UI to inform the player that they needed to ready up, Changed how the arrow turret worked by making it only fire in bursts when an enemy enters it's attack range, Spawned a minion for the player to play as while a wave is on going
