overview: After discussing my desire to create a game in Unreal my mentor suggested I start on adding features to the base Unreal Stratergy game that Epic provide. My Mentor had also upgrade the stratergy game to work with Unreal Engine 5 So this was my first project in that unreal version. I set out some goals for myself when starting this project which where to update the wave behaviour, Change how the arrow turret works and have some sort of third person mode within the game.
bullets: Add new wave start called buying where players will be able to buy towers without the threat of an on going wave, Made it so the player had to ready up to leave the buying state, Programmed simple UI to inform the player that they needed to ready up, Changed how the arrow turret worked by making it only fire in bursts when an enemy enters it's attack range, Started to implement the ability to control an allied minion during the wave
