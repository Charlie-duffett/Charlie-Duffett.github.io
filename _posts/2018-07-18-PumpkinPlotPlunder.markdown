overview: Pumpkin Plot Plunder was a game created with a small as part of a skills challenge with my course. We had 8 weeks to create a game with the theme Autumn Harvest. We settled on a chaos management game where you had to keep pumpkins happy while they grow and harvest them before the turned evil! We had also thought about making it a Roguelike game but decided not to due to the time constraints.
bullets: Setup hub github repo with required GitIgnore so we could all contribute to the project. (Git used as its free and quick to setup), Created pumpkins with state system, Created multiple interfaces for Damage_ Interaction_ Watering and Using (Activating), Created multiple blueprint callable functions that could be used by designers to play sound or create UI, Created basic UI to walk to the player (Ran out of time to polish this better as the pumpkin walk speed changed last minute), Mentored other members on the team how to use Git and some parts of Unreal Engine such as blueprints
